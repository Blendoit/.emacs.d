* Installation

** GNU Emacs

*** Linux

Use your package manager.

/Use Arch Linux. Duna√°t make me say it twice./

*** Windows

Head on over to https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/download.html
and download yourself a /fresh/ copy of GNU Emacs.

** My distribution
  
*** Linux

Backup your current =~/.emacs.d= with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bkp
#+END_SRC

Clone my configuration folder to your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Blendoit/.emacs.d.git
#+END_SRC

*** Windows

Download a =.zip= of the files in this repository. Then, extract the =.zip=, and
rename the extracted folder to =.emacs.d=. Place this folder it in your home
folder (one level up from =Documents=, =Pictures= or =Desktop=).

* Main Files

** =init.el=

This is the first editable file that GNU Emacs loads on startup. This file's
only purpose is to load my literate configuration =blendoit/init-blendoit.org=.
    
** =init-custom.el=

All customization options available in Emacs' GUI that can be saved with
=Options - Save Options= are saved here.

This is useful to fool around with GUI customization options, without breaking
our manually written code.

** =blendoit/init-blendoit.org=
   
This is my personal literate configuration files.
 
* Usage

  Each configuration file is commented.
