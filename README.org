* Installation
  
** Linux
   1. Backup your current =~/.emacs.d= with the following command:
   =mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bkp=
   2. Clone my configuration folder to your home directory:
   =cd ~= followed by =git clone https://github.com/Blendoit/.emacs.d.git=

* Main Files

** =init.el=
   - Loads the following 2 configuration files.

** =init_emacs.el=
   - You may delete its content initially.
   - By default, all customization options available in Emacs' GUI that can be saved with =Options - Save Options= are saved here.
   - Useful to fool around with GUI customization options, without breaking our manually written code.
     
** =init_blendoit.el=
   - Load my personal configuration files.

* Usage

  Each configuration file is commented.
