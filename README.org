* Installation
  
** Linux

Backup your current =~/.emacs.d= with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC: emacs-lisp
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bkp
#+END_SRC

Clone my configuration folder to your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC: emacs-lisp
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Blendoit/.emacs.d.git
#+END_SRC

* Main Files

** =init.el=

   - This file's only purpose is to load my literate configuration.

** =blendoit/init-blendoit.org=
   
   - Load my personal literate configuration files.
    
** =blendoit/custom-file.el=

   - By default, all customization options available in Emacs' GUI that can be
     saved with =Options - Save Options= are saved here.
   - This is useful to fool around with GUI customization options, without
     breaking our manually written code.
 
* Usage

  Each configuration file is commented.
