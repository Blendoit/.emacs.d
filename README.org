* Main Files

** =init.el=
   - Loads the following 2 configuration files.

** =init_emacs.el=
   - You may delete its content initially.
   - By default, all customization options available in Emacs' GUI that can be saved with =Options - Save Options= are saved here.
   - Useful to fool around with GUI customization options, without breaking our manually written code.
