* Welcome to *Smart Documents*.

** Work with /plain text/.

The only expectation from the user is to focus on the content, /plain
text./

Program your documents in your favorite language thanks to the power
of [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Org Babel]].

** Collaboration done right.

Collect collaborators' feedback and create new document versions
through an efficient wizard.

** Link it all together.

Create links between files to keep track of dates, people, tags, and
compile them into neatly filtered agendas fit for sharing.

* Killer Features

** A single authoritative document.

Each document can be declined into a report, a presentation
summarizing the document's outline, or a website page that can be
added to your organization's internal wiki.

** 

** Program your documents.

Unleash the power of /literate programming/ through Org mode.
